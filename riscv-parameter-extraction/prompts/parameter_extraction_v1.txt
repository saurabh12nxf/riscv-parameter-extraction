You are an expert in RISC-V architecture specification analysis. Your task is to extract architectural parameters from the following text excerpt from the RISC-V Privileged ISA Specification.

## CLASSIFICATION RULES

### 1. NAMED Parameters
- Parameters with explicit names in diagrams and clear descriptions
- Have official field names in the specification
- Example: "SD" (State Dirty), "MIE" (Machine Interrupt Enable)

### 2. UNNAMED Parameters
- Reserved bits or fields without official names
- May be labeled as "Reserved", "WPRI", "WARL", or have generic placeholders
- Require unique naming following the pattern: <REGISTER>_RESERVED_<BIT_RANGE>
- Example: "MSTATUS_RESERVED_4" for reserved bit 4 in mstatus

### 3. CONFIG-DEPENDENT Parameters
- Parameters that only exist when specific extensions are implemented
- Behavior changes based on XLEN (32-bit vs 64-bit)
- Must have explicit dependency mentioned in specification
- Example: "VS" field only exists if V (Vector) extension is implemented

## FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Named, Config-Dependent
```json
{
  "name": "SD",
  "bit_range_rv32": "31",
  "bit_range_rv64": "63",
  "type": "NAMED",
  "config_dependency": "F or V extension",
  "description": "State Dirty - Read-only bit that summarizes whether either the FS, XS, or VS fields signal the presence of some dirty state",
  "reasoning": "Has explicit name 'SD' in diagram, clear description, and dependency on F or V extensions stated in text"
}
```

### Example 2: Named, Not Config-Dependent
```json
{
  "name": "MPP",
  "bit_range_rv32": "12-11",
  "bit_range_rv64": "12-11",
  "type": "NAMED",
  "config_dependency": null,
  "description": "Machine Previous Privilege - Holds the privilege mode prior to a trap",
  "reasoning": "Has explicit name 'MPP', clear description, always present in mstatus register"
}
```

### Example 3: Unnamed (Reserved)
```json
{
  "name": "MSTATUS_RESERVED_4",
  "bit_range_rv32": "4",
  "bit_range_rv64": "4",
  "type": "UNNAMED",
  "config_dependency": null,
  "description": "Reserved bit, must be preserved on write",
  "reasoning": "Labeled as 'Reserved' in specification, no official name provided, assigned unique name following convention"
}
```

### Example 4: Config-Dependent with XLEN
```json
{
  "name": "SXL",
  "bit_range_rv32": null,
  "bit_range_rv64": "35-34",
  "type": "CONFIG_DEPENDENT",
  "config_dependency": "S extension and XLEN=64",
  "description": "Supervisor XLEN - Controls the effective XLEN for S-mode",
  "reasoning": "Only exists in RV64 (not in RV32), requires S extension, explicitly stated as configuration-dependent"
}
```

## IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Extract ALL parameters** mentioned in the text, including reserved bits
2. **Parse both RV32 and RV64 layouts** separately if provided
3. **Do NOT infer dependencies** not explicitly stated in the text
4. **Do NOT hallucinate** field names or descriptions
5. **Assign unique names** to unnamed/reserved bits using the convention: <REGISTER>_RESERVED_<BIT_RANGE>
6. **Include confidence score** (0-100) for each parameter
7. **Provide reasoning** for each classification decision

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "register_name": "mstatus",
  "source": "RISC-V Privileged ISA Specification, Chapter 3",
  "total_parameters": 22,
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "SD",
      "bit_range_rv32": "31",
      "bit_range_rv64": "63",
      "type": "NAMED | UNNAMED | CONFIG_DEPENDENT",
      "config_dependency": "extension or XLEN requirement, or null",
      "description": "Brief description from spec",
      "reasoning": "Why this classification was chosen",
      "confidence": 95
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Any additional observations or uncertainties"
}
```

## YOUR TASK

Analyze the above text and extract ALL architectural parameters following the classification rules and output format. Be thorough and conservative - if unsure about a dependency, mark it as null rather than guessing.
